You are attempting to index into the last element of the array 
like a hash by passing it a string as a key. Arrays need 
and integer index hence ruby complains of no implicit conversion 
of String into Integer.

It can be fixed by:

# provide integer index
names[3] = 'jody' 

# pass the string 'margaret' to an array helper which will retrieve the correct index
names[names.index('margaret')] = 'jody'
