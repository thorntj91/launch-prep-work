In each case 3 is printed to the screen.
The only difference between the two is that in the second instance.
Instead of X being used directly as the incrementing variable whose value is printed to 
the command line after the loop terminates as in the first example.
In the second, Y is used as a temporary variable to increment itself 3 times in the loop subsequently
assigning its value to x. Therefore, at the end of the loop x = 3.
